integrated_writing_one = '''Altruism is a type of behavior in which an animal sacrifices its own interest for that of
another animal or group of animals. Altruism is the opposite of selfishness; individuals
performing altruistic acts gain nothing for themselves.
Examples of altruism abound, both among humans and among other mammals.
Unselfish acts among humans range from the sharing of food with strangers to the
donation of body organs to family members, and even to strangers. Such acts are altruistic in that they benefit another, yet provide little reward to the one performing the act.
In fact, many species of animals appear willing to sacrifice food, or even their
life, to assist other members of their group. The meerkat, which is a mammal that
dwells in burrows in grassland areas of Africa, is often cited as an example. In groups
of meerkats, an individual acts as a sentinel, standing guard and looking out for
predators while the others hunt for food or eat food they have obtained. If the sentinel meerkat sees a predator such as a hawk approaching the group, it gives an
alarm cry alerting the other meerkats to run and seek shelter. By standing guard,
the sentinel meerkat gains nothing—it goes without food while the others eat, and
it places itself in grave danger. After it issues an alarm, it has to flee alone, which might
make it more at risk to a predator, since animals in groups are often able to work together
to fend off a predator. So the altruistic sentinel behavior helps ensure the survival of
other members of the meerkat’s group.'''

integrated_writing_two = '''Professors are normally found in university classrooms, offices, and libraries doing
research and lecturing to their students. More and more, however, they also appear as
guests on television news programs, giving expert commentary on the latest events in
the world. These television appearances are of great benefit to the professors themselves
as well as to their universities and the general public.
Professors benefit from appearing on television because by doing so they acquire
reputations as authorities in their academic fields among a much wider audience than 
they have on campus. If a professor publishes views in an academic journal, only other
scholars will learn about and appreciate those views. But when a professor appears on
TV, thousands of people outside the narrow academic community become aware of the
professor’s ideas. So when professors share their ideas with a television audience, the
professors’ importance as scholars is enhanced.
Universities also benefit from such appearances. The universities receive positive
publicity when their professors appear on TV. When people see a knowledgeable faculty member of a university on television, they think more highly of that university. That
then leads to an improved reputation for the university. And that improved reputation
in turn leads to more donations for the university and more applications from potential
students.
Finally, the public gains from professors’ appearing on television. Most television
viewers normally have no contact with university professors. When professors appear
on television, viewers have a chance to learn from experts and to be exposed to views
they might otherwise never hear about. Television is generally a medium for commentary that tends to be superficial, not deep or thoughtful. From professors on television, by contrast, viewers get a taste of real expertise and insight.'''

integrated_writing_three = '''Rembrandt is the most famous of the seventeenth-century Dutch painters. However,
there are doubts whether some paintings attributed to Rembrandt were actually painted
by him. One such painting is known as Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet.
The painting was attributed to Rembrandt because of its style, and indeed the representation of the woman’s face is very much like that of portraits known to be by Rembrandt. But there are problems with the painting that suggest it could not be a work by
Rembrandt.
First, there is something inconsistent about the way the woman in the portrait is dressed. She is wearing a white linen cap of a kind that only servants would wear—yet the coat she is wearing has a luxurious fur collar that no servant could afford. Rembrandt, who was known for his attention to the details of his subjects' clothing, would not have been guilty of such an inconsistency. 
Second, Rembrandt was a master of painting light and shadow, but in this painting these elements do not fit together. The face appears to be illuminated by light reflected onto it from below. But below the face is the dark fur collar, which would absorb light rather than reflect it. So the face should appear partially in shadow—which is not how it appears. Rembrandt would never have made such an error. 
Finally, examination of the back of the painting reveals that it was painted on a panel made of several pieces of wood glued together. Although Rembrandt often painted on wood panels, no painting known to be by Rembrandt uses a panel glued together in this way from several pieces of wood. 
For these reasons the painting was removed from the official catalog of Rembrandt's paintings in the 1930s.'''

integrated_writing_four = '''In the 1950s Torreya taxifolia, a type of evergreen tree once very common in the state of
Florida, started to die out. No one is sure exactly what caused the decline, but chances
are good that if nothing is done, Torreya will soon become extinct. Experts are considering three ways to address the decline of Torreya.
The first option is to reestablish Torreya in the same location in which it thrived for
thousands of years. Torreya used to be found in abundance in the northern part of Florida, which has a specific microclimate. A microclimate exists when weather conditions
inside a relatively small area differ from the region of which that area is a part. Northern
Florida’s microclimate is very favorable to Torreya’s growth. This microclimate is wetter
and cooler than the surrounding region’s relatively dry, warm climate. Scientists have
been working to plant Torreya seeds in the coolest, dampest areas of the microclimate.
The second option is to move Torreya to an entirely different location, far from its
Florida microclimate. Torreya seeds and saplings have been successfully planted and
grown in forests further north, where the temperature is significantly cooler. Some scientists believe that Torreya probably thrived in areas much further north in the distant past,
so by relocating it now, in a process known as assisted migration, humans would simply
be helping Torreya return to an environment that is more suited to its survival.
The third option is to preserve Torreya in research centers. Seeds and saplings can be
moved from the wild and preserved in a closely monitored environment where it will be
easier for scientists both to protect the species and to conduct research on Torreya. This
research can then be used to ensure the continued survival of the species.'''
